# Assignment2

THIS CODE GOT UPDATED LATE BECAUSE I FAILED TO UPLOAD AS I PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED. I WAS PUSHING TO A SUBMODULE WHICH WAS FAILING TO CORRECTLY UPDATE.

Horse Navigating map with Astar

My code is uncompleted and fails to compile.

Ive tracked the error to my Astar scoring section.

I can build any size map and convert the entries to Nodes

I can find all the nodes neighbors

My Astar search function is the root of my problem.
